# Rewards for Co-Teaching Sessions

## Project Description
The "Rewards for Co-Teaching Sessions" smart contract is designed to incentivize collaborative teaching activities. Teachers can create and participate in co-teaching sessions and earn tokens as rewards based on the session's duration. This system promotes collaboration and rewards educators for their valuable contributions.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a fair and transparent system that encourages co-teaching and collaboration among educators. By rewarding teachers for their time and effort, we aim to foster a culture of shared knowledge and mutual growth.

## Key Features
- **ERC-20 Token Integration**: The system uses `CoTeachToken` (CTT) as the reward currency.
- **Session Creation**: Admin can create co-teaching sessions with a list of participants.
- **Automated Rewards Distribution**: Tokens are automatically distributed among participants based on session duration.
- **Customizable Reward Rate**: Admin can adjust the reward rate per minute.
- **Transparency**: Every session's details, including participants and rewards, are stored on-chain for accountability.

## Future Enhancements
- **Decentralized Governance**: Introduce a governance mechanism where token holders can vote on reward rate adjustments or other system parameters.
- **Participant-Led Session Creation**: Allow participants to create sessions without requiring admin intervention, with proper validation.
- **Dynamic Reward Rates**: Implement variable reward rates based on factors such as session type, participant roles, or time of day.
- **Session Feedback System**: Enable participants to provide feedback or ratings for sessions, fostering quality improvement.
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Integrate with e-learning platforms to automate session tracking and reward distribution.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard for tracking session statistics, reward history, and participant contributions.
- **NFT Badges**: Issue non-fungible token (NFT) badges to participants for milestones or exemplary performance in co-teaching.
